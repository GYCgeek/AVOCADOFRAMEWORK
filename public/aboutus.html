        <h1>ðŸ¥‘ About the Avocado Framework (AF)</h1>
        <p>The Avocado Framework is a youth-led climate strategy to turn global negotiations into real action. Born from the Global Youth Coalition and guided by voices from over 178 countries, it is a living, evolving blueprint for planetary transformation â€” from the grassroots to the global stage. Today, AF belongs to everyone building a livable future.</p>

        <h2>We believe change must happen at every level:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Seed</strong> (individuals & communities)</li>
            <li><strong>The Flesh</strong> (businesses & civil society)</li>
            <li><strong>The Skin</strong> (governments & institutions)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All wrapped around the avocado itself â€” our living planet.</p>

        <h2>Our work is structured through ðŸ”± The Trident:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clean Energy Transition (CET)</strong> â€“ A just shift from fossil fuels.</li>
            <li><strong>Nature-Based Solutions (NBS)</strong> â€“ Protecting ecosystems with Indigenous and local leadership.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss & Damage (LD)</strong> â€“ Ensuring fair repair for the communities already affected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Unlike static reports, the bottom up Avocado Framework is:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Living</strong> â€“ open to public contributions via our Seed Wall</li>
            <li><strong>Practical</strong> â€“ connected to real-world implementation</li>
            <li><strong>Inclusive</strong> â€“ grounded in diverse youth leadership</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whether you're a negotiator, student, policymaker, or curious human â€” this is your invitation to co-create the future.</p>
